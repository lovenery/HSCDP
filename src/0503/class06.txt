Floods in north and central China have killed at least 150 people, with scores missing and hundreds of thousands forced from homes, officials say.
Hebei and Henan provinces are the worst hit by the flash floods and landslides.
At least 114 people have been killed in Hebei, with 111 missing and 53,000 houses destroyed, officials say.
In one city, Xingtai, at least 25 people died, prompting people to demonstrate against the government for failing to warn them of the flooding.
Thousands of villagers blocked a road on Friday, but police were sent to the scene to halt the protest, according to the South China Morning Post.
The villagers complained about a lack of flood warnings and ineffective rescue efforts.
